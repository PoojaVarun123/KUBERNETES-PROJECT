=======================================================================================================================================================
1. What is Amazon EC2 and what are its primary features?
    Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity (virtual machines) in the cloud. 
    It enables developers to run applications on scalable infrastructure without the need for hardware investment.
    Primary features:
      Elasticity: Scale in or out based on demand.
      Multiple instance types: Choose instances optimized for compute, memory, storage, etc.
      Custom AMIs: Launch pre-configured or custom OS images.
      Security: Control access using key pairs, security groups, and IAM.
      Cost-effective: Pay only for what you use.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. What are the different types of EC2 instances?
    EC2 instances are grouped into families optimized for different workloads:
    Instance Family Use Case Example
      General Purpose (t3, t4g, m5) Balanced CPU-memory (web servers)
      Compute Optimized (c5, c6g) High-performance CPUs (batch processing, game servers)
      Memory Optimized (r5, x1e) RAM-heavy workloads (in-memory DBs, caching)
      Storage Optimized (i3, d2) High IOPS (data warehouses, NoSQL DBs)
      Accelerated Computing (p3, g4) GPUs for ML, AI, video rendering
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Explain On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot Instances.
    On-Demand: Pay-per-use. No commitment. Ideal for unpredictable workloads.
    Reserved: Commit to 1 or 3 years for significant discounts (up to 72%). Ideal for long-term, steady workloads.  
    Spot: Use spare AWS capacity for up to 90% off. Good for fault-tolerant, stateless applications but may be interrupted by 
    AWS with 2 minutes’ notice.
        Type Use Case
              On-Demand Testing, short-term spikes
              Reserved Long-term production apps
              Spot Data analysis, CI/CD, batch jobs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. What is an EC2 AMI?
    AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a template that contains the software configuration needed to launch EC2 instances. This includes:
        A base operating system
        Application server (e.g., Apache, Tomcat)
        Custom application code
        Optional data/configuration
Use Case: Launch 10 identical web servers using a custom AMI with all pre-installed components.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. What is the difference between an AMI and a snapshot?
    Feature AMI Snapshot
        Purpose > Launch EC2 instances > Backup EBS volume
        Components > OS, software, > volume info, settings Data only (no boot info)
        Usage > Instance creation > Volume restoration or AMI creation
        File > System Full image with boot record > Volume-level backup only
Summary: AMIs can include snapshots but are used for launching new EC2 instances. Snapshots are just backups of EBS volumes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. What is an Elastic IP and how is it different from a public IP?
    Elastic IP (EIP) is a static public IPv4 address that is associated with your AWS account.
    Key differences:
        Elastic IP stays the same even if the instance is stopped and restarted.
        Default public IP changes every time you stop/start the instance.
        Use Case: Hosting a production web server where the IP must remain consistent for DNS.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Explain the lifecycle of an EC2 instance.
    EC2 instance states:
      State Description
          Pending Instance is launching
          Running Operational and reachable
          Stopping Instance is shutting down (retain EBS)
          Stopped Instance is off (no charges for compute)
          Shutting-down Instance is terminating (data may be lost)
          Terminated Instance and attached ephemeral storage are gone
Tip: You can stop/start to avoid costs or update OS/configurations.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. What is the use of a key pair in EC2?
    Key Pair = Public + Private Key
    AWS stores the public key on the instance.
    You download the private key (.pem) and use it to SSH securely into the EC2 instance.
Use Case: Secure login to Linux-based EC2 without needing a password.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. How do EC2 instance types differ by generation and family?
    Generation: Indicates hardware/software updates.
    E.g., m3 → m4 → m5 → m6i — newer means better performance and efficiency.
    Family: Indicates purpose.
    t: Burstable
    m: General purpose
    c: Compute
    r: Memory
    g: Graviton (ARM-based processors)
Example: c6g.large is a compute-optimized, 6th-gen, ARM-based instance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. What is instance store volume? How does it differ from EBS?
    Feature Instance Store EBS
      Type - Ephemeral, local disk - Persistent block storage
      Data - Retention Lost on stop/terminate   - Retains data after stop
      Bootable - Yes (with AMI)  - Yes
      Performance - Very fast, tied to instance host  - High, scalable, network-attached
Use Case: Caching, temporary files, batch processing (data can be lost).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. What is the difference between stopping and terminating an EC2 instance?
    Stopping an instance:
        When you stop an EC2 instance, it shuts down the operating system (like doing a clean shutdown of your desktop/laptop).
        The instance enters the stopped state.
        You can start it again, and it retains the same instance ID (unless changed by configuration).
        The root EBS volume and attached EBS volumes remain intact.
        You only pay for EBS storage, not compute.
    Terminating an instance:
        When you terminate an EC2 instance, it is permanently deleted.
        All associated EBS volumes are deleted (unless "Delete on Termination" is set to false).
        You cannot restart a terminated instance—it’s gone forever.
        Elastic IPs, if associated, are disassociated and may incur charges.

Key Difference:
Stop = Temporary shutdown (can be restarted).
Terminate = Permanent deletion.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. What are security groups in EC2 and how do they work?
    Security Groups (SGs) are virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic for EC2 instances at the instance level.
    They are stateful, meaning if an incoming request is allowed, the response is automatically allowed.
    You attach one or more security groups to each instance.
    Rules include protocol, port range, and source/destination (IP or SG ID).
      Example:
          Allow SSH (TCP port 22) from your office IP.
          Allow HTTP (TCP port 80) from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0).
    Important points:
          No deny rules—only allow rules.
          Changes to SGs apply immediately.
          Default SG allows all traffic within instances associated with it but blocks all external access unless modified.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. How does EC2 Auto Scaling work and when would you use it?
      Auto Scaling automatically adds or removes EC2 instances based on demand.
      Components:
          1. Launch Template/Configuration: Defines instance details (AMI, instance type, etc.).
          2. Auto Scaling Group (ASG): Manages EC2 fleet in multiple AZs.
          3. Scaling Policies: Trigger scale-out or scale-in based on CloudWatch metrics (e.g., CPU > 70%).
      Use Cases:
          Traffic spikes (e.g., during sales).
          Fault tolerance (if an instance fails, a new one is launched).
          Cost optimization (scale in during low demand).
      Benefits:
          High availability
          Elastic capacity
          Optimized cost
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. What are placement groups in EC2 and why are they used?
      Placement Groups define how instances are physically arranged on hardware within an AZ.
      Types:
          1. Cluster – Instances placed close together for low latency, high throughput. Ideal for HPC or tightly-coupled apps.
          2. Spread – Instances placed on different hardware to reduce single point of failure. Good for critical apps.
          3. Partition – Divides group into partitions to isolate groups of instances (used in big data like Hadoop).
      Use Case:
          Cluster for performance
          Spread for fault tolerance
          Partition for scalable, fault-isolated workloads
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. What are EC2 instance metadata and how can you access it?
      Metadata provides information about an instance from within the instance itself (not from the AWS console).
      Accessed via HTTP: http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
      Includes: instance ID, AMI ID, public IP, IAM role, user-data script, region, etc.
      Use Cases:
        Scripts needing dynamic config (e.g., get region for app logic).
        Getting credentials for IAM role attached to the instance.
        Security Tip: Don’t expose metadata endpoint to users or containers. Use IMDSv2 for enhanced security.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16. What is the difference between EC2 Classic and VPC?
      Note: EC2 Classic is now retired.
      EC2-Classic (Legacy):
          Instances share a single, flat network.
          No VPC segmentation
          Limited control over IP addressing and network config.
      EC2 in VPC (current model):
              Each instance launches inside a user-defined VPC.
              Fine-grained control over subnets, route tables, security groups, and network ACLs.
              More secure and flexible.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17. How do you connect to a Windows EC2 instance?
      1. Launch a Windows EC2 instance with RDP enabled (port 3389).
      2. Download the private key (.pem) used in the key pair.
      3. Get the Administrator password by:
        Selecting the instance → Actions → Get Windows Password → Upload .pem file.
      4. Use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) tool:
          IP: Instance’s public DNS or IP.
          Credentials: Administrator + decrypted password
          Ensure:
              Port 3389 is open in the Security Group.
              You are using the correct user (Administrator or custom).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18. How do you connect to a Linux EC2 instance?
      1. Use SSH from terminal or PuTTY (on Windows).
      2. Command: ssh -i /path/to/key.pem ec2-user@<public-dns>
      3. Ensure:
            Key file has correct permissions (chmod 400).
            Security Group allows SSH (TCP 22).
            Correct username (ec2-user, ubuntu, centos, etc., based on AMI).
            Troubleshooting Tips:
              Check firewall or IP block.
              Ensure instance is running and reachable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19. What are network interfaces (ENIs) in EC2?
    An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is a virtual network card attached to an EC2 instance.
    Attributes:
        Private IPs
        Public IPs (optional)
        Security Groups
        MAC address
    Use Cases:
        High availability (move ENI to another instance).
        Load balancing (one ENI, multiple backends).
        Multiple NICs for multi-VPC or multi-subnet apps.
        Primary ENI is created at launch. You can attach secondary ENIs dynamically.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20. How do you monitor EC2 instances?
    Monitoring tools:
        1. Amazon CloudWatch – Collects metrics (CPU, disk, network).
        2. CloudWatch Alarms – Trigger actions (e.g., Auto Scaling, email via SNS).
        3. EC2 Status Checks:
        System Status: AWS infrastructure.
        Instance Status: Inside the VM (e.g., OS boot)
        Custom Metrics:
        Install CloudWatch Agent to monitor disk, memory, application logs.
Best Practices:
      Set alarms on CPU, disk space
      Enable detailed monitoring (1-minute intervals).
      Use CloudWatch Logs and dashboards.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. What is EC2 Hibernate and how is it different from Stop?
    Hibernate and Stop both suspend an instance, but their behavior differs:
🔸 EC2 Stop:
    Shuts down the instance OS.
    Clears memory (RAM) contents.
    Keeps EBS volumes, but not the in-memory state.
    When restarted, the instance boots from scratch like a fresh start.

🔸 EC2 Hibernate:
    Saves the contents of the RAM to the root EBS volume.
    Preserves the in-memory state of applications.
    On restart, the instance resumes exactly where it left off.
    Instance RAM must be ≤150 GB, and the instance must be EBS-backed.
  Use Cases:
    Long-running processes (e.g., simulations) where you want to pause and resume without reconfiguring.
    Faster recovery from interruption.
    Suitable for dev/test environments.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22. What are Elastic IPs in EC2 and when should you use them?
      Elastic IP (EIP) is a static, public IPv4 address that you can allocate and associate with any EC2 instance.
      Why use it?
          Dynamic public IPs change when an instance is stopped/started.
          EIP remains constant, even if you stop/start or replace the instance.
    Key Points:
          You can remap an EIP to another instance instantly.
          You’re charged only when it's not associated with a running instance.
    Useful for:
          Hosting public services (e.g., web servers).
          Disaster recovery—easily remap EIP to a backup instance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23. What is EC2 Instance Store and how is it different from EBS?
    🔸 Instance Store:
        Ephemeral (temporary) block storage physically attached to the host.
        Data is lost when the instance stops or terminates.
        Very fast, low latency.
        No backup or snapshot support
    🔸 EBS (Elastic Block Store):
        Persistent storage across reboots, stops, and terminations.
        Data survives instance lifecycle (unless "delete on termination" is enabled).
        Supports snapshots, encryption, resizing, etc.
    Use Case Comparison:
        Use Instance Store for temporary data, caches, buffers.
        Use EBS for databases, logs, application data that must persist.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. How can you encrypt data on an EC2 instance?
    You can encrypt EC2 data at three levels:
    1. At-rest encryption (EBS volumes):
        Use AWS-managed keys (KMS) or your own customer-managed keys (CMK).
        Automatically encrypts data stored in EBS.
        Also applies to snapshots and AMIs created from the volume.
    2. In-transit encryption:
        Use protocols like TLS/SSL to encrypt network data.
        Can be used for apps like HTTPS, SSH, VPN, etc.
    3. Application-level encryption:
        Encrypt data before writing to disk using libraries like AWS Encryption SDK, KMS API.
Best Practice: Enable EBS encryption by default using service-wide settings or launch templates.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25. What are EC2 Spot Instances and when should you use them?
    Spot Instances allow you to bid on unused EC2 capacity at up to 90% lower cost than On-Demand.
    Characteristics:
        AWS can reclaim the instance with 2-minute warning when capacity is needed.
        Instances can be interrupted at any time.
        Ideal Use Cases:
          Batch jobs
          Big data analytics
          Machine learning training
          CI/CD workloads
          Fault-tolerant apps
How to use Spot wisely:
        Use Auto Scaling Groups with Spot + On-Demand mix (Spot Fleet).
            Use Spot Blocks for time-bound, interruption-tolerant workloads.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26. What is EC2 Fleet?
    EC2 Fleet allows you to launch a mix of On-Demand, Spot, and Reserved Instances across different instance types and AZs using a single API call.
Why it's useful:
      Automatically optimizes cost and capacity.
      Combines multiple purchase models.
      Good for large-scale, flexible workloads.
      Example: Request:
        70% Spot
        20% On-Demand
        10% Reserved
AWS will intelligently provision based on your allocation strategy (lowest price, diversified, capacity-optimized).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27. What is a key pair in EC2?
    A key pair consists of:
        Public key: Stored by AWS and injected into the instance.
        Private key: Downloaded and kept secure by the user (.pem file).
    Purpose:
        Secure SSH/RDP access to EC2 instances.
    How it works:
        AWS injects the public key into the instance’s metadata.
        When you connect (e.g., via SSH), you authenticate using your private key.
    Important:
        You can't retrieve a lost private key from AWS.
        You must create a new key pair and attach it via instance recovery or image recreation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28. What are EC2 status checks?
    EC2 performs two types of status checks:
    1. System Status Check:
          Detects issues with the underlying AWS hardware or network.
          Example: Power failure, loss of network, physical host issues.
    2. Instance Status Check:
          Detects issues inside the instance, such as:
              OS crashes
              Misconfigured networking
              Software hangs
If failed:
System status → Wait or stop/start instance.
Instance status → Troubleshoot instance (logs, EC2 serial console, etc.).
You can also configure CloudWatch Alarms to act on failures.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29. What are Reserved Instances and how do they save cost?
    Reserved Instances (RIs) are EC2 instances you commit to using for 1 or 3 years in exchange for significant discounts (up to 75%).
    Types:
        Standard RIs: Up to 75% off; less flexible but cheaper.
        Convertible RIs: Up to 54% off; can change instance family/type.
        Scheduled RIs: Reserved for specific recurring time windows.
    Key Concepts:
        You’re not reserving capacity (unless in a specific region).
        Applies billing discount automatically to matching On-Demand instances.
    Great for:
        Predictable workloads (e.g., web servers, databases).
        Long-term applications with steady usage.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
30. What are launch templates in EC2 and how are they used?
    Launch templates define reusable configurations for launching EC2 instances or Auto Scaling Groups.
    Contains:
      AMI ID
      Instance type
      Key pair
      Network settings (VPC, subnet)
      User data scripts
      Tags
      IAM role
    Benefits:
        Reduces human error.
        Consistent environment across teams.
        Supports versioning (track changes over time).
        Required for newer services like EC2 Spot Fleets, Auto Scaling, and EC2 Fleet.
        Launch Templates vs Launch Configurations:
        Launch Configs are legacy and don’t support all features (e.g., T2/T3 credit specs, multiple instance types).
        Launch Templates are more modern and preferred.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
31. What is a Placement Group in EC2? What are the types and use cases?
    A Placement Group is a logical grouping of instances within a single AZ or across AZs to control how your instances are physically
    placed on AWS infrastructure.
  Types of Placement Groups:
      🔸 1. Cluster Placement Group
        Instances are placed close together in a single AZ.
        Offers low latency and high throughput.
        Best for:
            HPC (High Performance Computing)
            Distributed applications (e.g., Cassandra, Hadoop)
      🔸 2. Spread Placement Group
        Instances are spread across distinct underlying hardware.
        Minimizes risk from hardware failure.
        Limited to 7 instances per AZ per group.
      Best for:
        Critical applications that must not share hardware (e.g., DB, core services).
🔸 3. Partition Placement Group
        Divides instances into logical partitions (max 7).
        Each partition uses isolated racks (network + power).
        Used in large-scale, fault-tolerant systems like HDFS, Kafka, or Cassandra.
---
Important Notes:
You must launch instances into the group from the start.
You can’t change the placement type of an existing group.
Cluster Placement Group can fail if not enough capacity is available.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
32. How do EC2 instances communicate across regions and AZs?
  🔹 Within a Region (across AZs):
      All AZs in a region are connected with low-latency, high-bandwidth links.
      You can use private IPs across AZs within the same VPC.
      Traffic is free across AZs only for private IP-to-private IP in the same region.
🔹 Across Regions:
      EC2 instances communicate using public IPs or VPC peering, Transit Gateway, or VPN/Direct Connect.
      Latency is higher.
      Data transfer charges apply (e.g., $0.02–$0.09 per GB depending on region).
Tips:
    Use VPC Peering or Transit Gateway for private IP connectivity across VPCs/regions.
    Use Global Accelerator or CloudFront for optimized cross-region access.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
33. How does EC2 Auto Recovery work and how is it configured?
    EC2 Auto Recovery allows you to automatically recover an instance when the underlying hardware or hypervisor fails.
    Key Points:
        Recovery action stops the instance on faulty hardware and restarts it on new hardware.
        The instance ID and data remain the same.
        Only certain instance types support this (e.g., Nitro-based instances).
    How to Configure:
        Create a CloudWatch Alarm on StatusCheckFailed_System.
        Set alarm action to "Recover this instance".
        Metric: StatusCheckFailed_System
        Alarm action: Recover
    Use Case:
        Mission-critical applications (e.g., production web server, database node) that require zero downtime from hardware failures.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
34. How do you troubleshoot SSH connection issues to an EC2 instance?
    Steps to troubleshoot:
        1. Check Security Group Rules:
            Ensure port 22 is open to your IP or CIDR.
            Verify there's no implicit deny.
        2. Check NACL Rules:
            Ensure both inbound/outbound rules allow SSH (port 22) and ephemeral ports.
        3. Verify Private Key:
            Use the correct .pem file.
            Set correct permissions: chmod 400 mykey.pem.
        4. Public IP or Elastic IP:
            Confirm the instance has a public/elastic IP.
            Use correct IP in SSH command.
        5. Check Instance State:
            Must be running and reachable.
        6. Use EC2 Serial Console (Linux):
            For Nitro-based EC2, enables OS-level access even if network is misconfigured.
        7. Review System Logs:
            Via EC2 → Actions → Instance Settings → Get System Log.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
35. What is the EC2 Serial Console and when would you use it?
    The EC2 Serial Console provides low-level access to the instance console output (stdin/stdout), just like you’d get with a physical server monitor/keyboard.
    Benefits:
      Helps in troubleshooting boot-level or networking issues.
      Useful when SSH is broken (e.g., due to wrong firewall rules or OS misconfiguration).
    Requirements:
      Nitro-based instance.
      IAM permission: ec2-instance-connect:SendSerialConsoleSSHPublicKey
      Serial console must be enabled at the account level.
    Example Usage:
      Forgot to allow SSH? Fix networking config through the serial console.
      Fix /etc/fstab or boot loop errors without detaching the root volume.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
36. What are EC2 Host Tenancy options?
    EC2 instances support different tenancy models:
    🔸 1. Shared Tenancy (default):
        Instances run on shared hardware.
        Cost-effective.
        Best for most workloads
    🔸 2. Dedicated Instance:
        Run on hardware dedicated to a single customer.
        Still share hardware across your own instances.
        Slightly higher cost than shared tenancy.
    🔸 3. Dedicated Host:
      Gives you a physical server reserved for your use.
      Required for:
      Software licensing compliance (e.g., SQL Server, Oracle).
      Visibility into sockets, cores, and host IDs.
    Use Cases:
      Compliance requirements (e.g., finance, healthcare).
      BYOL (Bring Your Own License) scenarios.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
37. How does Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) integrate with EC2?
    An ELB distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to improve fault tolerance and availability.
    ELB Types:
        Application Load Balancer (ALB): HTTP/HTTPS (Layer 7)
        Network Load Balancer (NLB): TCP/UDP (Layer 4)
        Gateway Load Balancer: Used for 3rd-party appliances
  EC2 Integration:
      ELB is registered with EC2 instances or target groups.
      Performs health checks—only routes to healthy instances.
      Supports Auto Scaling integration to register/deregister instances dynamically.
  Benefits:
      Zero-downtime deployments using weighted target groups.
      SSL offloading and termination.
      Horizontal scaling of EC2 services.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
39. How do you configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on CPU and custom metrics?
    Auto Scaling allows you to automatically increase or decrease EC2 instances based on metrics.
    Steps to Configure:
    1. Create Launch Template:
        Define instance config, key pair, security group.
    2. Create Auto Scaling Group (ASG):
        Define min, max, and desired capacity.
        Attach to VPC, subnets, ELB (optional).
    3. Define Scaling Policies:
        Target Tracking: e.g., maintain 50% CPU.
        Step Scaling: scale by X instances when threshold is crossed.
        Scheduled Scaling: grow/shrink based on time (e.g., business hours).
    4. Use CloudWatch Custom Metrics (optional):
        Push app-specific metrics (e.g., queue length).
        Create alarm → ASG scaling policy.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
40. How would you architect a highly available EC2-based web application?
    A highly available web app on EC2 should be resilient across multiple Availability Zones, Auto Scaling, and use managed AWS services where possible.
    Architecture:
        1. Network:
            VPC with public and private subnets in 2+ AZs.
            Use NAT Gateway for outbound internet for private instances.
        2. Compute:
            EC2 instances in Auto Scaling Group across multiple AZs.
            Launch Template for standardization.
            Placement Groups (optional).
        3. Load Balancer:
            Use ALB in front of instances.
            Route traffic based on URL paths (microservices architecture).
        4. Storage:
            Use EBS for instance storage.
            S3 for static assets (e.g., images, CSS, JS).
        5. Database:
            Use RDS with Multi-AZ for HA.
            Or Aurora Serverless for autoscaling.
        6. Security:
            IAM roles for EC2.
            Security Groups and NACLs for fine-grained access.
        7. Monitoring:
            CloudWatch metrics, alarms, logs.
            Enable auto-recovery and CloudTrail auditing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
41. What is the difference between rebooting, stopping, and terminating an EC2 instance?
      Action Description Data Loss Risk Billing Impact
      Reboot Restarts the OS without changing instance ID, IP, or volume ❌ No 💰 Continues
Stop Powers off the instance (like a shutdown), retains instance ID & EBS ❌ No (EBS only) 💰 EBS only is charged
Terminate Deletes the instance and attached non-persistent EBS volumes ✅ Yes (if not retained) 💰 Stops all billing
Reboot is used for software updates or troubleshooting without IP change (unless using auto-assigned public IP).
Stop is good for temporary shutdown (e.g., night hours); saves cost but keeps data.
Terminate is final—used when you no longer need the instance.
> 📌 Note: Instance store (ephemeral) volumes are lost on stop or terminate.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
42. What is an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) and when would you use multiple ENIs?
      An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is a virtual NIC that can be attached to an EC2 instance.
Features:
      Each ENI has its own private IP, MAC, security groups, and optionally public IP.
      You can attach/detach ENIs between instances (only for secondary ENIs).
      Can have multiple ENIs per instance (based on instance type).
Use Cases for Multiple ENIs:
  Multi-homed architecture (e.g., routing between different subnets or networks).
    High availability failover: move ENI to standby instance in failover event.
    Network appliances: firewalls, load balancers needing ingress and egress interfaces.
> 📌 Only one primary ENI can be auto-attached at boot. Secondary ENIs must be managed manually or via automation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
43. How do you handle data backup and recovery in EC2?
Backup Options:
    1. Amazon Machine Image (AMI):
        Snapshot + metadata (OS + configuration).
        Recreate identical EC2 instance.
    2. EBS Snapshots:
        Block-level incremental backups.
        Can be automated via Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM).
    3. AWS Backup Service:
        Centralized backup for EC2, EFS, RDS, DynamoDB, etc.
        Define backup plans and retention.
    4. File-Level Backup:
        Use agents/tools like AWS DataSync, rsync, or third-party (e.g., Veeam, Bacula).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recovery Strategy:
      Use EBS snapshots to restore volumes.
      Use AMI to spin up identical replacement instance.
      For automated recovery, create CloudWatch alarms + Lambda function to auto-recover.
> Best Practice: Always test backup recovery processes (DR drills).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
44. How would you ensure an EC2 instance is secure?
1. Use IAM Roles (not keys):
    Assign least-privilege IAM roles to EC2.
    Avoid hardcoding access keys
2. Security Groups:
      Deny all by default.
      Open only necessary ports/IPs (e.g., SSH from office IP only).
3. Use EC2 Key Pairs:
      Use .pem files for SSH.
      Rotate keys regularly.
4. Patch the OS & software:
      Automate updates with SSM or cron.
5. Encrypt Data:
      EBS volumes → KMS encryption.
      File-level encryption for sensitive files.
6. Enable Logging & Monitoring:
      CloudWatch Agent for logs/metrics.
      Enable CloudTrail for audit logging.
7. Restrict outbound internet access:
      Use NAT + VPC endpoints to control traffic.
      Enable egress rules in SG/NACLs carefully.
8. Disable password login in SSH (use only key-based auth).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
46. How do EC2 Spot Instances work and when should you use them?
Spot Instances let you use spare EC2 capacity at up to 90% discount.
Key Concepts:
      Priced dynamically.
      AWS can reclaim the instance with 2-minute notice.
Spot Lifecycle:
      Request → Launch → Run → Interrupted (if needed) → Terminate
Use Cases:
      Stateless apps.
      Batch jobs (e.g., encoding, ML training).
      Container workloads (ECS, EKS with spot node groups).
      CI/CD runners.
Interruption Handling:
      Use EC2 Spot Fleet with On-Demand fallbacks.
      Monitor SpotInstanceInterruptionNotice from metadata endpoint
> ⚠️ Not recommended for stateful or production DB workloads unless managed carefully.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
47. What is EC2 Instance Refresh in Auto Scaling and how does it help?
Instance Refresh allows rolling updates to instances in an ASG without full replacement.
Why use it?
      Update launch templates (AMI, userdata, instance type).
      Replace unhealthy or out-of-date instances automatically.
Features:
      Rolling replacements.
      Option to pause, skip failed replacements, set minimum healthy percentage.
      Can be triggered manually or with CloudWatch alarms.
> 📌 Safer alternative to terminating all and re-creating—supports blue/green-like update pattern.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
48. How can you reduce EC2 cost in a large environment?
1. Right-size Instances:
      Use Compute Optimizer or CloudWatch metrics.
2. Use Auto Scaling:
      Scale in/out based on load to avoid overprovisioning.
3. Use Spot Instances:
      Replace non-critical workloads with Spot.
4. Use Savings Plans or Reserved Instances:
      For predictable workloads (1-3 year commitment).
5. Schedule Stop/Start:
      Dev/stage instances can shut down overnight/weekends.
6. Use Graviton (ARM) instances:
      Up to 40% better price-performance.
7. Delete unused EBS volumes, snapshots, and Elastic IPs
8. Use consolidated billing for volume discounts.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
49. What are some best practices when launching EC2 in production?
✅ Use Latest AMIs:
    Keep OS updated and hardened.
✅ Use IAM Roles:
    Attach roles instead of embedding credentials.
✅ Enable Detailed Monitoring:
    1-minute granularity for better visibility.
✅ Auto Scaling Groups:
    Ensures HA and dynamic scaling.
✅ Elastic Load Balancer:
    Distribute traffic and improve fault tolerance.
✅ CloudWatch Alarms:
    Monitor CPU, memory, disk, and custom app metrics.
✅ Backups:
    Enable regular EBS snapshots and AMI rotations.
✅ Tagging:
    Use for cost tracking, automation, access control.
✅ Secure SSH Access:
    Use bastion hosts or Session Manager via SSM.
✅ Placement Groups (if needed):
    For latency-sensitive or fault-isolated apps.
