Here’s a comprehensive fake interview based on Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) and Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) tailored for a candidate with 5 years of DevOps experience. It includes:

✅ Theoretical questions

✅ Scenario-based questions

✅ High-level architectural questions

✅ Detailed and in-depth answers

✅ PART 1: EBS Interview Questions & Answers
1. What is Amazon EBS? How does it differ from EC2 instance store?
Answer:
Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) provides persistent, block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances. It allows you to attach volumes to instances and retain data independently from the instance lifecycle.

Key Differences:

Feature	EBS	Instance Store
Data Persistence	Persistent	Ephemeral (lost on stop/terminate)
Backup Support	Snapshots supported	No backup
Durability	High (replicated within AZ)	No replication
Use Case	Databases, file systems	Temp scratch space, buffer

2. Explain the different types of EBS volumes.
Answer:

Volume Type	Use Case	IOPS	Throughput	Notes
gp3	General-purpose SSD	Up to 16,000	Up to 1,000 MB/s	Default choice
gp2	Older general-purpose SSD	3 IOPS/GB	Burstable	Replaced by gp3
io2/io2 Block Express	High-performance apps like DBs	Up to 256,000	High	Durable, 99.999% SLA
st1	Throughput-optimized HDD	Not for random I/O	Up to 500 MB/s	Cost-effective for large, sequential workloads
sc1	Cold HDD	Lowest cost	Max 250 MB/s	Archival, infrequent access

3. What is an EBS snapshot and how is it stored?
Answer:
An EBS snapshot is a point-in-time backup of an EBS volume stored in Amazon S3 (internally managed by AWS, not visible in your S3 buckets).

It's incremental – only changed blocks are saved after the first full snapshot.

You can use snapshots to:

Create new volumes

Move volumes across AZs or Regions

Backup for disaster recovery

4. Can we attach an EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances simultaneously?
Answer:
Not directly. EBS volumes are AZ-specific and attached to only one EC2 instance at a time (for most use cases).

✅ However, with EBS Multi-Attach (available for io1/io2 volumes), you can attach the same volume to multiple EC2 instances in the same AZ for read/write operations—ideal for clustered applications like Oracle RAC.

5. What happens when you stop or terminate an EC2 instance with EBS?
Answer:

Action	Effect on EBS volume
Stop	Volume remains attached
Terminate	If DeleteOnTermination = true, volume is deleted. Otherwise, it persists.

Use "DeleteOnTermination" attribute carefully based on data importance.

6. How do you increase the size and performance of an EBS volume?
Answer:

You can modify volume size, type, or IOPS using the ModifyVolume API or AWS Console.

No downtime required (online resizing).

Use lsblk, growpart, and resize2fs/xfs_growfs inside the EC2 instance to expand file system.

7. Scenario: You have a large application database on EBS that needs to scale reads across multiple EC2 instances. How would you approach this?
Answer:
EBS volumes are not ideal for horizontal read scaling. Instead:

Use EBS snapshots to create read-only clones for other EC2 instances.

Or better, migrate to Amazon RDS or Aurora which supports read replicas.

For file-based storage, use Amazon EFS (which supports multi-instance access).

8. High-Level Architecture: Design a backup and DR solution for EC2 instances with critical EBS volumes.
Answer:

Architecture Includes:

Regular EBS snapshots (automated via Lifecycle Policies or Lambda scripts).

Cross-region snapshot replication using copy-snapshot.

Tag-based snapshot automation using AWS Backup.

DR Plan: Create AMIs or launch EC2 instances from snapshots in secondary region.

9. What is the performance consistency of gp2 vs gp3 EBS volumes?
Answer:

gp2: Performance tied to size (3 IOPS per GB). Smaller volumes may suffer from IOPS burst limitations.

gp3: Consistent performance, independent of volume size. You can provision IOPS and throughput separately.

Use gp3 for better cost-performance tuning.

10. Can you encrypt EBS volumes?
Answer:
Yes. EBS supports encryption at rest using KMS. It also encrypts all snapshots and data-in-transit between instance and volume.

Encryption can be:

Enabled by default at account level

Applied to new volumes or snapshots

Not supported for retroactive encryption (need to create encrypted copy)

✅ PART 2: EFS Interview Questions & Answers
1. What is Amazon EFS and how is it different from EBS?
Answer:
Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) is a managed NFS-based file system that allows multiple EC2 instances to access the same data concurrently.

Feature	EBS	EFS
Access	Single EC2	Multiple EC2 (NFS)
Type	Block storage	File storage
Performance	SSD/HDD-backed	Bursting or Provisioned throughput
Use Case	DBs, boot volumes	Shared file systems, containers, CMS

2. How is EFS data stored and accessed?
Answer:

Data is stored in multiple AZs in a region, ensuring high availability and durability.

EC2s mount EFS using NFSv4.1/4.2 protocol.

EFS uses Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) in your VPC to expose mount targets per AZ.

3. Explain EFS Performance Modes and Throughput Modes.
Answer:

Performance Modes:

General Purpose (default) – For latency-sensitive workloads.

Max I/O – For highly parallel workloads (e.g., big data).

Throughput Modes:

Bursting (default) – Scales with storage size.

Provisioned – Set a fixed throughput regardless of storage.

4. Scenario: You are running a WordPress application in an Auto Scaling group. How do you manage shared media file access?
Answer:

Use Amazon EFS for shared media:

Create EFS and mount it across all EC2s (ASG).

Point WordPress wp-content/uploads directory to the EFS mount.

This ensures high availability, consistency, and durability for shared files.

5. How do you mount EFS on an EC2 instance?
Answer:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Install NFS client
sudo yum install -y nfs-utils

# Create mount point
sudo mkdir /mnt/efs

# Mount EFS
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1 fs-xxxxxxxx.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ /mnt/efs
To persist the mount, update /etc/fstab.

6. How does EFS handle scaling and storage limits?
Answer:

EFS automatically scales from gigabytes to petabytes.

You pay only for what you use (no pre-provisioning).

It’s ideal for unpredictable or growing workloads.

7. High-Level Architecture: Design a shared storage system for containerized microservices in EKS that need access to the same configuration files.
Answer:

Architecture:

Use Amazon EFS CSI driver in EKS.

Create a PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) pointing to EFS.

Mount the PVC into containers using Kubernetes volume mounts.

Use EFS as a central config store.

8. What are the EFS storage classes?
Answer:

Class	Description	Use Case
Standard	Default, high availability	Frequent access
Infrequent Access (IA)	Lower-cost tier	Files not accessed for 30+ days

You can enable Lifecycle Management to move files to IA automatically.

9. How does EFS ensure data durability and availability?
Answer:

Stores data redundantly across multiple AZs.

Designed for 99.999999999% (11 9s) durability.

Accessed via regional endpoints with multiple mount targets per AZ for HA.

10. Can you encrypt EFS data?
Answer:

Yes. Encryption options:

At Rest: Enabled using AWS KMS when file system is created.

In Transit: Mount with TLS using Amazon EFS mount helper (amazon-efs-utils).

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mount -t efs -o tls fs-xxxxxxx:/ /mnt/efs
✅ Summary Table: EBS vs EFS
Feature	EBS	EFS
Storage Type	Block	File
Multi-AZ	No	Yes
Multi-instance access	No (except io2 Multi-Attach)	Yes
Ideal for	Databases, boot volumes	Web servers, shared storage
Mount Type	One EC2	Many EC2s
Throughput	Provisioned per volume	Elastic/provisioned per filesystem

Absolutely! Here's Part 2 with more advanced, scenario-based, high-level architecture, and theoretical questions for EBS and EFS, each with detailed and deeply technical answers — perfect for DevOps interviews.

✅ Advanced Amazon EBS Interview Questions
11. Scenario:
Your EBS volume is taking a long time to restore from a snapshot. How would you speed up performance after restore?

Answer:

When you create an EBS volume from a snapshot, data is lazy-loaded from Amazon S3 — the first read of every block incurs additional latency.

To improve performance:

Pre-warm the volume:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo dd if=/dev/xvdf of=/dev/null bs=1M
This forces all blocks to be fetched upfront.

Use Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR):

Enables full performance immediately after restore.

Must be enabled in advance per AZ.

Costs extra.

12. How do EBS Snapshots support incremental backups?
Answer:

The first snapshot is a full copy of the volume.

Subsequent snapshots only copy changed blocks, significantly reducing:

Storage costs

Backup time

AWS manages the snapshot chain; deletion of a snapshot doesn't break the chain due to block reference handling.

13. Scenario:
How would you migrate an EBS volume from one region to another?

Answer:

Steps:

Create a snapshot of the volume.

Use copy-snapshot to copy it to another region:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws ec2 copy-snapshot --source-region us-east-1 --source-snapshot-id snap-xxxxxx --destination-region us-west-1
In the destination region, create a new volume from the copied snapshot.

Attach the new volume to an EC2 instance in that region.

14. How does EBS handle data durability and availability?
Answer:

Data is replicated within the AZ where the volume resides.

EBS volumes are designed for 99.999% availability and 99.999% durability.

EBS doesn’t support cross-AZ replication — use snapshots or other services for DR.

15. High-Level Architecture:
Design a scalable web app with high-performance backend DB using EBS. Ensure performance, DR, and backup.

Answer:

Components:

EC2 instances with io2 EBS volumes for databases (e.g., MySQL).

Use EBS Multi-Attach if shared storage required (e.g., clustered DBs).

Enable Fast Snapshot Restore for low RTO.

Automate snapshots using AWS Backup or Lambda cron.

Replicate snapshots to secondary region for DR.

Monitor EBS IOPS/latency using CloudWatch.

16. Can we share EBS snapshots between accounts?
Answer:

Yes:

Share snapshots manually or via AWS Resource Access Manager.

Only unencrypted snapshots can be shared directly.

Encrypted snapshots require sharing the KMS key with the target account as well.

✅ Advanced Amazon EFS Interview Questions
11. Scenario:
Your EFS throughput is insufficient during peak times. What can be done?

Answer:

Options:

Switch to Provisioned Throughput Mode:

Allows you to manually provision throughput independent of storage size.

Review performance mode:

Use Max I/O for large-scale parallel workloads.

Analyze file access patterns and optimize:

Small-file heavy workloads may underperform on EFS.

12. How does EFS lifecycle management work?
Answer:

EFS uses access-based tiering:

Files not accessed for a configured number of days (e.g., 30) are moved to Infrequent Access (IA).

Accessing IA files automatically moves them back to Standard tier.

Saves costs for cold data.

You can configure policies like AFTER_30_DAYS, AFTER_7_DAYS, etc.

13. Scenario:
You want to allow EKS containers to access shared configuration files. How do you implement this with EFS?

Answer:

Steps:

Create an EFS file system.

Install the EFS CSI Driver on your EKS cluster.

Create:

PersistentVolume (PV) with EFS.

PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).

Mount the PVC into required Pods via volumeMounts.

Benefits:

Shared access

Durable storage

Serverless scalability

14. High-Level Architecture:
Design a multi-region media hosting solution that allows EC2s across regions to share large media files using EFS.

Answer:

EFS is regional, not global. Cross-region sharing options:

Use AWS DataSync to sync EFS between regions.

Store media in S3 with Transfer Acceleration or CloudFront for global access.

In each region:

Use EFS as a cache/local share.

Sync nightly or periodically from primary region.

Alternative: Use S3 + EFS hybrid approach for global sync with local cache.

15. How is EFS different from FSx?
Answer:

Feature	Amazon EFS	Amazon FSx
Protocol	NFS	SMB (FSx for Windows), Lustre (FSx for Lustre)
Use Case	Linux apps, shared storage	Windows apps, HPC workloads
Performance	Scales automatically	High-performance tuning required
POSIX-compliant	Yes	Yes (Lustre), No (Windows FSx)

16. Can you mount EFS on on-premise systems?
Answer:

Yes, using AWS Direct Connect or AWS VPN:

EFS is accessed via mount targets in your VPC.

On-prem clients must:

Use NFSv4.1

Route through private link (VPN/Direct Connect)

EFS IPs must be resolvable via VPC DNS.

Use for hybrid cloud or migration scenarios.
