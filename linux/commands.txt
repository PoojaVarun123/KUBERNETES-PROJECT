====================================================================================
                                      LINUX COMMANDS
====================================================================================
1) ps aux  : process status
  -a : show processes for all users
  -u : show the process user/owner and more datailed info like CPU and memory usage
  -x : show processes not attache to terminal ( eg:background services or daemons
   ps aux | grep apache
   ps aux --sort=-%mem | head
   ps aux | grep nginx or systemctl status nginx

curl ifconfig.me---public adrress
rsync -avz -e "ssh -i ec2key.pem" z4.txt ubuntu@65.0.170.15:/home/ubuntu/
scp -i ./ec2key.pem z4.txt ubuntu@65.0.170.15:/home/ubuntu/

2) top 
  -ps used by all uers
  - memory ,total tasks
  - cpu, load average
  - swap memory, uptime 
  -its like more live every 5 seconds it will get updated

3) netstat 
  -  sudo netstat -tulnp | grep nginx
  -  sudo ss -tulnp | grep nginx     (cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf)
====================================================================================
1. htop – Interactive Process Viewer

2. lsof – List Open Files and Sockets

3. journalctl – View System Logs (Systemd)
  journalctl -xe
  journalctl -u nginx

4. systemctl – Manage Systemd Services

5. du – Check Disk Usage
    du -sh /var/*
  
6. df – Check Disk Space Usage

7. free – Check Memory and Swap Usage

8. uptime – Check System Uptime and Load Average

9. top – The Basic Real-Time System Monitor

10. ps aux – Take a Snapshot of Running Processes: ps aux gives you a complete snapshot – 
who’s running what, how much CPU and memory they’re using, and more.
  
11. netstat / ss – Check Network Connections:  ss -tuln
  
12. ip – Network Interface and Routing
The ip command is the modern replacement for the old ifconfig and route commands. 
  If you’re still using ifconfig, it’s time to switch – ip is more powerful, actively maintained, and available by default on all modern Linux distributions.  
  ip a        # Shows all IP addresses and network interfaces
  ip r        # Displays the system's routing table

13. ping – Network Connectivity
`  ping -c 4 google.com

14. traceroute / tracepath – Network Route Debugging
When a server or website isn’t responding, and ping is giving you no answers, 
it’s time to see how your packets are traveling across the network and where they’re getting stuck.

15. nc (Netcat) – Test Port Connectivity
check if a port is open and reachable on a remote machine – super handy for troubleshooting services like SSH, web servers, or database ports.
Let’s say you want to test if SSH (port 22) is open on a remote server 192.168.1.10.
nc -zv 192.168.1.10 22

16. rsync – Sync Files Over SSH
When it comes to backing up or syncing files, nothing beats rsync, which is fast, efficient, and network-friendly. 
Unlike scp, which copies everything from scratch, rsync only transfers changed parts of files, which saves both time and bandwidth.
rsync -avz /data/ user@remote:/backup/

17. crontab – Schedule Jobs (Task Automation): 0 2 * * * /usr/bin/backup.sh

18. tail -f – Live Log MonitoringWhen something goes wrong on a Linux system, logs are usually the first place you should look. 
  The tail -f command lets you watch logs in real time, which is super helpful for debugging.
  tail -f /var/log/messages

19. chmod and chown – File Permissions and Ownership
Managing file permissions is crucial on any Linux system, and these two commands help you control who can access what:
chmod sets permissions (read, write, execute).
chown changes the owner and group.

20. find – Search for Files
    find /var/log -name "*.log"
    find /tmp -type f -mtime +7 -delete
