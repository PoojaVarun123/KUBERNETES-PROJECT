Pre-requisites:
HPA > metrics server + Resource Requests/Limit in pods + prometheus Adapter(optional) for custom metrics
VPA > metrice server + vertical pod autoscaler + Resource Requests/Limit in pods
cluster > cluster autoscaler + iam role and policy that allow autoscaling + Resource Requests/Limit in pods + nodegroup with max/min capacity
=========================================================================================
HorizontalPodAutoscaler
=========================================================================================
-Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) → Scale by Number of Pods
-Increases or decreases the number of pod replicas based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.
-Your app gets sudden traffic spikes → new pods are added automatically.
=========================================================================================
Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA) → Scale Pod Resource Limits (CPU/Memory)
=========================================================================================
-Adjusts the CPU and memory requests/limits of the pod automatically, but doesn’t change the number of pods
-A long-running app that uses more memory over time → memory request is increased.
-Cost-saving: reducing unused resource reservations.

✅ Example: VPA YAML (Recommendation Only)

apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-app-vpa
  namespace: production
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: "apps/v1"
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  updatePolicy:
    updateMode: "Auto"  # Options: Auto, Off, Initial

✅ Real-time Example:

A data-processing app’s memory usage grows → VPA increases the pod memory request to avoid OOM.


✅ Note:

VPA restarts pods to apply changes.

Works best for batch jobs, data crunching, ML apps.

=========================================================================================
Cluster Autoscaling → Scale Node Pool (Add/Remove Worker Nodes)
=========================================================================================
Increases or decreases the number of EC2 instances (nodes) in your cluster when:
  -There are pending pods that can't be scheduled (scale out).
  -Nodes are under-utilized (scale in).
Running jobs that suddenly need more CPU/RAM → cluster adds new nodes automatically.


✅ Example: EKS with Cluster Autoscaler
1. Install Cluster Autoscaler:
helm upgrade --install cluster-autoscaler \
  oci://registry.k8s.io/autoscaling/cluster-autoscaler-chart \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --set autoDiscovery.clusterName=your-cluster-name \
  --set awsRegion=us-east-1

2. IAM permissions for nodes to allow autoscaling.
App uses HPA to scale to 30 pods → current nodes can’t handle it → 

Cluster Autoscaler adds 2 new EC2 instances → pods get scheduled.

✅ Works with:
AWS EKS (Managed Node Groups or EC2 Auto Scaling Groups)
GKE
AKS





✅ Quick Summary Table:
HorizontalPodAutoscaler : (HPA) Number of pods CPU, Memory, Custom Metrics > Web apps, APIs, real-time scaling
VerticalPodAutoscaler : (VPA) CPU/Memory of pods > Resource usage Stateful apps, data crunching, cost-saving
Cluster Autoscaler : Number of cluster nodes Pending pods, idle nodes Ensuring pods always find compute



---

🛠 Real-time Combined Example (Used in Production):

1) App Deployment has HPA:
minReplicas: 3
maxReplicas: 20

2) Pods have VPA to automatically increase memory request from 512Mi → 1Gi as needed.

3) Cluster Autoscaler is running → scales nodes when new pods can’t be scheduled.


✅ Result:
Auto pod scale
Auto pod resource tuning
Auto node scale

Perfect—here’s how you can extend your Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to include both Memory and Custom Metrics along with CPU for a full production-grade real-time autoscaling setup.


---

✅ 1️


---

✅ Real Production Notes:

Component Needed? Used For

Metrics Server ✅ Mandatory CPU & Memory metrics
Prometheus Adapter ✅ Optional Custom application metrics (K8s native)
KEDA ✅ Optional Event-driven autoscaling (queue length, external)



---

✅ Example Custom Metric Names you can use (with Prometheus Adapter):

http_requests_total

queue_length

latency_seconds



---

👉 If you’d like: ✅ I can help you set up Prometheus Adapter YAMLs for custom metrics.
✅ Or give you a Jenkinsfile to trigger actions based on scaling events.

Would you like to go deeper into any of these?

✅ To achieve all three types of autoscaling in Kubernetes—Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA), Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA), and Cluster Autoscaler (CA)—you need to set up specific prerequisites for each.

Here’s a real-world production checklist for each one:


---

🚀 1️⃣ Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) — Pod Count Scaling

✅ Prerequisites:

Requirement Why Needed? How to Set Up

Metrics Server HPA relies on live CPU/Memory metrics kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
Resource Requests/Limits Pods must define requests and limits for CPU & Memory Add resources section in deployment YAML
Autoscaling API Kubernetes 1.18+ preferred for v2 HPA Use autoscaling/v2 in HPA YAML
Optional: Custom Metrics Provider Needed for autoscaling on custom metrics like QPS, latency Prometheus Adapter or KEDA


✅ HPA Only = ✅ Metrics Server + ✅ Resource Requests


---

🚀 2️⃣ Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA) — Pod Resource Scaling (CPU/Memory)

✅ Prerequisites:

Requirement Why Needed? How to Set Up

VPA Controller Installed Provides recommendations and updates pod resources Install VPA: https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler
Metrics Server Used for collecting CPU/Memory data Same as HPA
VPA YAML Must create a VerticalPodAutoscaler object linked to the Deployment VPA YAML
Restartable Pods VPA changes are applied via Pod restarts App should tolerate restarts gracefully


✅ VPA Only = ✅ VPA Controller + ✅ Metrics Server + ✅ Pod restart tolerance


---

🚀 3️⃣ Cluster Autoscaler (CA) — Node Count Scaling

✅ Prerequisites:

Requirement Why Needed? How to Set Up

Cluster Autoscaler Installed Automatically adjusts node pool size Install via Helm or YAML (EKS, GKE, AKS)
IAM/Node Group Permissions (EKS) Needed to allow ASG scale-up/down Add AutoScalingFullAccess or custom IAM policy
Proper Node Group Setup Managed Node Group or ASG with min/max sizes EKS Console / Terraform setup
Pods with Resource Requests To trigger scaling when unschedulable Same as HPA requirements


✅ Cluster Autoscaler Only = ✅ CA Installed + ✅ Node Group configured with autoscaling + ✅ IAM Role


---

📝 Full Prerequisites Table (All Three Together):

Component HPA VPA Cluster Autoscaler

✅ Metrics Server ✔️ ✔️ Optional (but useful)
✅ Resource Requests/Limits in Pods ✔️ ✔️ ✔️
✅ VPA Controller Installed  ✔️ 
✅ Cluster Autoscaler Installed   ✔️
✅ Node Group with min/max capacity   ✔️
✅ IAM Role (EKS/AWS)   ✔️
✅ App tolerates restarts (for VPA)  ✔️ 
✅ Optional: Prometheus Adapter/KEDA ✔️ (for custom metrics)  



---

🔗 Real-Time Flow (All 3 Working Together):

1. HPA scales number of pods based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.


2. If the nodes run out of space → Cluster Autoscaler adds new nodes automatically.


3. If pods start using more memory/CPU than initially requested → VPA adjusts pod resource limits and triggers rolling restarts.



✅ This combination is used in large production systems (banks, SaaS, e-commerce) where:

Apps scale up/down based on load (HPA)

Pods get right-sized (VPA)

Cluster elasticity is maintained (CA)



---

👉 I can help you: ✅ Install Metrics Server, VPA, and Cluster Autoscaler step by step.
✅ Write YAMLs for all 3 autoscalers.
✅ Provide EKS setup with IAM for autoscaling.
