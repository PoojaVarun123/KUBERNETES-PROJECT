CUSTOM RESOURCE DEFINITIONS (CRDs)
Extensions to Kubernetes that let you create new resource types‚Äîcustom ones, beyond the default ones like Pods, Services, etc.

‚úÖ What are the CRDs for AWS Load Balancer Controller?
When you install the AWS Load Balancer Controller in EKS, it adds new CRDs so Kubernetes can understand and manage AWS-specific 
resources.

targetgroupbindings.elbv2.k8s.aws Links Kubernetes Services to AWS Target Groups (for ALB/NLB)
üëâ It allows Kubernetes to manage AWS Target Groups that are part of Application Load Balancers.

kubectl get crds

Without CRD Kubernetes doesn‚Äôt know how to talk to AWS ALB/NLB.
With CRD (TargetGroupBinding) Kubernetes can tell AWS: "create target group", "attach service" etc.

‚úÖ CRDs You Might See in Other Controllers Too:
Controller / Tool Common CRDs Installed
AWS Load Balancer Controller > TargetGroupBinding
ExternalDNS > DNSEndpoint
Cert-Manager > Certificate, Issuer, ClusterIssuer
ArgoCD Application
Velero > Backup, Restore, Schedule

‚úÖ In short:
üëâ CRDs = New types of Kubernetes objects.
üëâ AWS ALB Controller installs TargetGroupBinding CRD so it can manage AWS-specific networking.

üëâ If you want, I can help you list all CRDs in your cluster or show how to write your own CRD from scratch.
Here‚Äôs a clear list of real-world scenarios where you need to install CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) in Kubernetes:


üöÄ Scenarios Where CRDs Are Required:
Scenario Why CRD is Needed Example CRD

1. Ingress Controllers (ALB, NGINX, Traefik) 
To define Ingress resources and sometimes advanced routing  > Ingress, IngressClass, IngressRoute (Traefik)
2. Storage (EBS CSI, EFS CSI, Snapshotting) 
To support dynamic provisioning, snapshots, and CSI features > VolumeSnapshot, VolumeSnapshotClass, CSIDriver
3. Service Mesh (Istio, Linkerd) 
To define virtual services, destinations, policies > VirtualService, DestinationRule, Policy
4. Monitoring (Prometheus Operator, Thanos) 
To define Prometheus, AlertManager, ServiceMonitors, etc. > ServiceMonitor, PrometheusRule, Alertmanager
5. Logging (Fluent Bit Operator, Loki Operator) 
To manage log pipelines declaratively > ClusterFlow, Output, LokiStack
6. Certificate Management (cert-manager) > 
To automate TLS certificates using ACME, Let's Encrypt > Certificate, Issuer, ClusterIssuer
7. External Secrets Management (ESO, Sealed Secrets) 
To sync secrets from cloud providers securely > ExternalSecret, SealedSecret
8. ArgoCD / GitOps 
To define Argo applications, projects, rollouts > Application, AppProject, Rollout
9. Kubernetes Operators (any operator pattern) 
Custom controllers that manage CRDs for specific applications > Operator-specific CRDs (e.g., KafkaTopic, MySQLCluster)
10. Network Policy / Security (Calico, Cilium, Kyverno) 
To extend Kubernetes network or security policies > GlobalNetworkPolicy, NetworkPolicy, ClusterPolicy

---
‚úÖ Real Examples:
Task CRDs Needed? Why?
Deploy EBS CSI Driver ‚úÖ Yes (VolumeSnapshot) For dynamic provisioning and snapshot support
Install cert-manager ‚úÖ Yes (Certificate, Issuer) To manage certificates in Kubernetes
Install ArgoCD ‚úÖ Yes (Application) To enable GitOps-driven deployments
Setup Calico ‚úÖ Yes (NetworkPolicy, GlobalNetworkPolicy) For advanced network segmentation
Basic pod deployment (no addons) ‚ùå No Kubernetes built-in resources only


‚úÖ Key Takeaways:
CRDs are required when you introduce anything beyond basic Kubernetes resources (Pods, Deployments, Services).
Any controller, operator, or custom API introduces its own CRDs.
Most Helm charts automatically install CRDs unless you opt out.
